Objective:
Perform a full linguistic audit and correction of all UI elements across three language interfaces (Arabic/English/German) with special focus on German localization accuracy.

Scope of Work:

    Full Content Review:

        Verify 100% of German translations across:

            Navigation menus

            Buttons (including new Telegram buttons)

            Tables (tasks, reports, data grids)

            Form fields

            Error messages

            Notifications

            Documentation/tooltips

    German-Specific Requirements:

        Ensure technical terms follow DIN standards

        Formal "Sie" form for all user-facing text

        Consistent noun capitalization

        Correct gender/article usage

        Accurate compound word construction

    Consistency Checks:

        Cross-validate translations against:

            Industry-standard Glossaries

            Previously approved translations

            Microsoft Language Portal recommendations

        Maintain consistent terminology for:

            "Task" = "Aufgabe" (not "Auftrag")

            "Client" = "Kunde" (not "Klient")

            "Send" = "Senden" (uniform across all buttons)

    Technical Verification:

        Confirm all dynamic elements (e.g., {task_id}) work in German UI

        Check datetime/number formatting (DD.MM.YYYY)

        Validate text expansion/contraction in UI containers

        Test RTL/LTR rendering where applicable

    QA Process:

        Perform 3-tier verification:

            Automated: Use Lokalise/Phrase checks

            Manual: Native German speaker review

            Functional: Test all workflows in German UI

Deliverables:

    Complete translation correction log

    Updated JSON/localization files with:

        All missing translations added

        Inconsistent terms standardized

        Grammatical errors corrected

    UI screenshots confirming fixes

Example Correction (Before → After):
"Send Client Data" → "Kundendaten senden"
"Task Table" → "Aufgabenliste"
"Start Time" → "Startzeit" (not "Beginn Zeit")

Timeframe:
Complete within 48 hours with daily progress reports.

Notes:

    Prioritize critical path elements (navigation, forms, alerts)

    Flag any culturally sensitive content requiring adaptation

    Verify all technical strings (e.g., callback_data) remain untranslated
