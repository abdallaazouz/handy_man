I want to modify the existing "Send to Telegram" button located in:

    Task table

    Task creation page

    Task card

This button should be replaced with two independent buttons with the following specifications:
First Button: "Send General Data"

    Functionality:

        Sends basic task information to a technician/group of technicians (or specific user)

        Data to include:

            TASK ID

            TASK TITLE

            DESCRIPTION

            DATE

            START TIME

            END TIME

    Features:

        Sends a separate Telegram message containing only this data

        Can be reused multiple times for the same task without restrictions (e.g., when editing)

Second Button: "Send Client Data"

    Functionality:

        Sends confidential information only to the assigned technician (manual process after task acceptance)

        The acceptance method will be programmed through message replies, with system notifications sent to us

        Data to include:

            TASK ID (for reference)

            CLIENT NAME

            CLIENT PHONE

            LOCATION MAP URL

    Features:

        Can be reused multiple times for the same task without restrictions

        Sends data only to the assigned technician (selected from dedicated list)

        Includes security warning: "This is confidential data - do not share with others"

        Logs each send event in the database (to prevent misuse)

Implementation Requirements:

    Both buttons should appear in:

        Task tables

        Task creation pages

        Task cards

    Technical specifications:

        Maintain existing TASK ID linking functionality

        New buttons should use separate callback queries

        Client data button should verify technician assignment before sending

        Implement reply-based acceptance system with admin notifications

    Security:

        Client data should only be sent via private messages

        All sends should be logged with timestamp and user info

    User Interface:

        Clear visual distinction between buttons (colors/icons)

        Appropriate confirmation messages after sending

        Warning messages for client data sends
